## :books: General info

* [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) used for API data
* More about webpack:

1. Webpack is a module bundler, but you can also use it for running tasks as well.
2. Webpack relies on a dependency graph underneath. Webpack traverses through the source to construct the graph, and it uses this information and configuration to generate bundles.
3. Webpack relies on loaders and plugins. Loaders operate on a module level, while plugins rely on hooks provided by webpack and have the best access to its execution process.
4. Webpackâ€™s configuration describes how to transform assets of the graphs and what kind of output it should generate. Part of this information can be included in the source itself if features like code splitting are used.
5. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) helped to popularize webpack. It's a feature that can enhance the development experience by updating code in the browser without needing a full page refresh.
6. Webpack can generate hashes for filenames allowing you to invalidate past bundles as their contents change.

## :camera: Screenshots

## :signal_strength: Technologies

* [Angular v14](https://angular.io/)
* [RxJS Library v7](https://angular.io/guide/rx-library) used to consume API data [observable](http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html).
* [Moment Custom Webpack Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-locales-webpack-plugin)  used to remove unused Moment.js locales when building with webpack

## :floppy_disk: Setup

* Run app using `ng serve to start the compiled build file.
* Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
* `npm run build` to create build folder.
* `npm run build:sm` to create build folder with source map files

## :computer: Code Examples

* `echo.service.ts` function to fetch API data

```typescript
public makeCall(): Observable<any> {
  return this.httpClient.get<any>(
    'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'
  ).pipe(
    take(1)
  );
}
```

## :cool: Features

* None

## :clipboard: Status & To-Do List

* Status: Working. Further Webpack optimization can be added to improve Lighthouse score.
* To-Do: Webpack config.
